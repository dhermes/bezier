***************
Adding Features
***************

In order to add a feature to ``bezier``:

#. **Discuss**: `File an issue`_ to notify maintainer(s) of the
   proposed changes (i.e. just sending a large PR with a finished
   feature may catch maintainer(s) off guard).

#. **Add tests**: The feature must work fully on CPython versions 3.6, 3.7 and
   3.8 and on PyPy 3; on Linux, macOS and Windows. In addition, the feature
   should have 100% line coverage.

#. **Documentation**: The feature must (should) be documented with
   helpful `doctest`_ examples wherever relevant.

.. _File an issue: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/new
.. _doctest: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/doctest.html

*************
``libbezier``
*************

To build the Fortran shared library directly, use `CMake`_ version
``3.1`` or later:

.. code-block:: console

   $ SRC_DIR="src/fortran/"
   $ BUILD_DIR=".../libbezier-debug/build"
   $ INSTALL_PREFIX=".../libbezier-debug/usr"
   $ mkdir -p "${{BUILD_DIR}}"
   $ cmake \
   >   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
   >   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="${{INSTALL_PREFIX}}" \
   >   -S "${{SRC_DIR}}" \
   >   -B "${{BUILD_DIR}}"
   $ cmake \
   >   --build "${{BUILD_DIR}}" \
   >   --config Debug \
   >   --target install

.. _CMake: https://cmake.org/

****************
Binary Extension
****************

Many low-level computations have alternate implementations in Fortran.
See the `Python Binary Extension`_ page for a more detailed description.

.. _Python Binary Extension: https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/{rtd_version}/python/binary-extension.html

Building / Compiling
====================

To compile the binary extension (with ``libbezier`` built and installed
already) run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ # One of
   $ BEZIER_INSTALL_PREFIX=.../usr/ python -m pip wheel .
   $ BEZIER_INSTALL_PREFIX=.../usr/ python -m pip install .
   $ BEZIER_INSTALL_PREFIX=.../usr/ python setup.py build_ext
   $ BEZIER_INSTALL_PREFIX=.../usr/ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Using a Release build of ``libbezier`` may make debugging more difficult.
Instead, a Debug build of ``libbezier`` will include debug symbols, without
optimizations that move code around, etc.

To explicitly disable the building of the extension, the
``BEZIER_NO_EXTENSION`` environment variable can be used:

.. code-block:: console

   $ BEZIER_NO_EXTENSION=True .../bin/python -m pip wheel .

This environment variable is actually used for the ``nox -s docs`` session
to emulate the `RTD`_ build environment (where no Fortran compiler is
present).

Dependencies
============

Currently, the ``src/fortran/quadpack`` `directory`_ has a subset of Fortran 77
subroutines from `QUADPACK`_. These are Public Domain, so they do not
conflict with the Apache 2.0 license (as far as we know). In addition it
contains another popular subroutine from NETLIB: ``d1mach`` (which the
QUADPACK subroutines depend on).

QUADPACK is used to perform numerical quadrature to compute the length
of a curve segment.

.. _directory: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/tree/{revision}/src/fortran/quadpack
.. _QUADPACK: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUADPACK

******************
Running Unit Tests
******************

We recommend using `Nox`_ to run unit tests:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nox -s "unit-3.6"
   $ nox -s "unit-3.7"
   $ nox -s "unit-3.8"
   $ nox -s "unit-pypy3"
   $ nox -s  unit  # Run all versions

However, `pytest`_ can be used directly (though it won't
manage dependencies or build the binary extension):

.. code-block:: console

   $ PYTHONPATH=src/python/ python3.6 -m pytest tests/unit/
   $ PYTHONPATH=src/python/ python3.7 -m pytest tests/unit/
   $ PYTHONPATH=src/python/ python3.8 -m pytest tests/unit/
   $ PYTHONPATH=src/python/ pypy3     -m pytest tests/unit/

.. _Nox: https://nox.readthedocs.io
.. _pytest: https://docs.pytest.org

Testing the Binary Extension
============================

When using ``nox``, ``libbezier`` will be built and installed into a well-known
``BEZIER_INSTALL_PREFIX`` within the ``nox`` envdir (typically ``.nox/``), the
``bezier`` package will automatically be installed into a virtual environment
and the binary extension will be built during install.

However, if the tests are run directly from the source tree via

.. code-block:: console

   $ PYTHONPATH=src/python/ python -m pytest tests/unit/

some unit tests may be skipped. The unit tests that explicitly exercise the
binary extension will skip (rather than fail) if the extension isn't
compiled (with ``build_ext --inplace``) and present in the source tree.

Test Coverage
=============

``bezier`` has 100% `line coverage`_. The coverage is checked
on every build and uploaded to `coveralls.io`_ via the
``COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN`` environment variable set in
the `CircleCI environment`_.

.. _line coverage: https://coveralls.io/github/dhermes/bezier
.. _coveralls.io: https://coveralls.io/
.. _CircleCI environment: https://circleci.com/gh/dhermes/bezier/edit#env-vars

To run the coverage report locally:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nox -s cover
   $ # OR
   $ PYTHONPATH=src/python/ python -m pytest \
   >   --cov=bezier \
   >   --cov=tests.unit \
   >   tests/unit/

Slow Tests
==========

To run unit tests without test cases that have been (explicitly)
marked slow, use the ``--ignore-slow`` flag:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nox -s "unit-3.6" -- --ignore-slow
   $ nox -s "unit-3.7" -- --ignore-slow
   $ nox -s "unit-3.8" -- --ignore-slow
   $ nox -s  unit      -- --ignore-slow

These slow tests have been identified via:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ...
   $ nox -s "unit-3.8" -- --durations=10

and then marked with ``pytest.mark.skipif``.

Slow Install
============

Installing NumPy with `PyPy`_ can take upwards of two minutes and
installing SciPy can take as much as seven minutes. This makes it
prohibitive to create a new environment for testing.

.. _PyPy: https://pypy.org/

In order to avoid this penalty, the ``WHEELHOUSE`` environment
variable can be used to instruct ``nox`` to install NumPy and SciPy
from locally built wheels when installing the ``pypy3`` sessions.

To pre-build NumPy and SciPy wheels:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pypy3 -m virtualenv pypy3-venv
   $ pypy3-venv/bin/python -m pip wheel --wheel-dir=${{WHEELHOUSE}} numpy
   $ pypy3-venv/bin/python -m pip install ${{WHEELHOUSE}}/numpy*.whl
   $ pypy3-venv/bin/python -m pip wheel --wheel-dir=${{WHEELHOUSE}} scipy
   $ rm -fr pypy3-venv/

In addition to the ``WHEELHOUSE`` environment variable, the paths
``${{HOME}}/wheelhouse`` and ``/wheelhouse`` will also be searched for
pre-built wheels.

Alternatively, wheels can be downloaded from `pypy-wheels`_, however
the SciPy wheel will still require ``libatlas-dev``, ``libblas-dev`` and
``liblapack-dev``.

The `Docker`_ image for the CircleCI test environment has already
pre-built these wheels and stored them in the ``/wheelhouse`` directory.
So, in the `CircleCI environment`_, the ``WHEELHOUSE`` environment
variable is set to ``/wheelhouse``.

.. _pypy-wheels: https://antocuni.github.io/pypy-wheels/

****************
Functional Tests
****************

Line coverage and unit tests are not entirely sufficient to
test **numerical software**. As a result, there is a fairly
large collection of `functional tests`_ for ``bezier``.

These give a broad sampling of curve-curve intersection,
triangle-triangle intersection and segment-box intersection problems to
check both the accuracy (i.e. detecting all intersections) and the
precision of the detected intersections.

To run the functional tests:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nox -s "functional-3.6"
   $ nox -s "functional-3.7"
   $ nox -s "functional-3.8"
   $ nox -s "functional-pypy3"
   $ nox -s  functional  # Run all versions
   $ # OR
   $ PYTHONPATH=src/python/ python3.6 -m pytest tests/functional/
   $ PYTHONPATH=src/python/ python3.7 -m pytest tests/functional/
   $ PYTHONPATH=src/python/ python3.8 -m pytest tests/functional/
   $ PYTHONPATH=src/python/ pypy3     -m pytest tests/functional/

.. _functional tests: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/tree/{revision}/tests/functional

For example, the following curve-curve intersection is a
functional test case:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhermes/bezier/{revision}/docs/images/curves11_and_26.png
   :align: center

and there is a `Curve-Curve Intersection`_ document which captures many of
the cases in the functional tests.

.. _Curve-Curve Intersection: https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/{rtd_version}/algorithms/curve-curve-intersection.html

A triangle-triangle intersection functional test case:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhermes/bezier/{revision}/docs/images/triangles1Q_and_2Q.png
   :align: center

a segment-box functional test case:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhermes/bezier/{revision}/docs/images/test_goes_through_box08.png
   :align: center

and a "locate point on triangle" functional test case:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhermes/bezier/{revision}/docs/images/test_triangle3_and_point1.png
   :align: center

Functional Test Data
====================

The curve-curve and triangle-triangle intersection test cases are stored in
JSON files:

* `curves.json`_
* `curve_intersections.json`_
* `triangles.json`_
* `triangle_intersections.json`_

This way, the test cases are programming language agnostic and can be
repurposed. The `JSON schema`_ for these files are stored in the
``tests/functional/schema`` directory.

.. _curves.json: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/{revision}/tests/functional/curves.json
.. _curve_intersections.json: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/{revision}/tests/functional/curve_intersections.json
.. _triangles.json: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/{revision}/tests/functional/triangles.json
.. _triangle_intersections.json: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/{revision}/tests/functional/triangle_intersections.json
.. _JSON schema: http://json-schema.org/

************
Coding Style
************

Code is `PEP8`_ compliant and this is enforced with `flake8`_
and `Pylint`_.

.. _PEP8: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
.. _flake8: http://flake8.pycqa.org
.. _Pylint: https://www.pylint.org

To check compliance:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nox -s lint

A few extensions and overrides have been specified in the `pylintrc`_
configuration for ``bezier``.

.. _pylintrc: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/{revision}/pylintrc

Docstring Style
===============

We require docstrings on all public objects and enforce this with
our ``lint`` checks. The docstrings mostly follow `PEP257`_
and are written in the `Google style`_, e.g.

.. code-block:: rest

   Args:
       path (str): The path of the file to wrap
       field_storage (FileStorage): The :class:`FileStorage` instance to wrap
       temporary (bool): Whether or not to delete the file when the File
          instance is destructed

   Returns:
       BufferedFileStorage: A buffered writable file descriptor

In order to support these in Sphinx, we use the `Napoleon`_ extension.
In addition, the `sphinx-docstring-typing`_ Sphinx extension is used to
allow for `type annotation`_ for arguments and result (introduced in
Python 3.5).

.. _PEP257: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
.. _Google style: https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#Comments__body
.. _Napoleon: https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io
.. _sphinx-docstring-typing: https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-docstring-typing/
.. _type annotation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html

*************
Documentation
*************

The documentation is built with `Sphinx`_ and automatically
updated on `RTD`_ every time a commit is pushed to ``master``.

.. _Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org
.. _RTD: https://readthedocs.org/

To build the documentation locally:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nox -s docs
   $ # OR (from a Python 3.6 or later environment)
   $ PYTHONPATH=src/python/ ./scripts/build_docs.sh

Documentation Snippets
======================

A large effort is made to provide useful snippets in documentation.
To make sure these snippets are valid (and remain valid over
time), `doctest`_ is used to check that the interpreter output
in the snippets are valid.

To run the documentation tests:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nox -s doctest
   $ # OR (from a Python 3.6 or later environment)
   $ PYTHONPATH=src/python/:. sphinx-build -W \
   >   -b doctest \
   >   -d docs/build/doctrees \
   >   docs \
   >   docs/build/doctest

Documentation Images
====================

Many images are included to illustrate the curves / triangles / etc.
under consideration and to display the result of the operation
being described. To keep these images up-to-date with the doctest
snippets, the images are created as doctest cleanup.

In addition, the images in the `Curve-Curve Intersection`_ document and
this document are generated as part of the functional tests.

To regenerate all the images:

.. code-block:: console

   $ nox -s docs_images
   $ # OR (from a Python 3.6 or later environment)
   $ export MATPLOTLIBRC=docs/ GENERATE_IMAGES=True PYTHONPATH=src/python/
   $ sphinx-build -W \
   >   -b doctest \
   >   -d docs/build/doctrees \
   >   docs \
   >   docs/build/doctest
   $ python tests/functional/make_segment_box_images.py
   $ python tests/functional/make_triangle_locate_images.py
   $ python tests/functional/make_curve_curve_images.py
   $ python tests/functional/make_triangle_triangle_images.py
   $ unset MATPLOTLIBRC GENERATE_IMAGES PYTHONPATH

**********************
Continuous Integration
**********************

Tests are run on `CircleCI`_ (Linux), `Travis CI`_ (macOS) and
`AppVeyor`_ (Windows) after every commit. To see which tests are run, see
the `CircleCI config`_, the `Travis config`_ and the `AppVeyor config`_.

On CircleCI, a `Docker`_ image is used to provide fine-grained control over
the environment. There is a base `python-multi Dockerfile`_ that just has the
Python versions we test in. The image used in our CircleCI builds (from
`bezier Dockerfile`_) installs dependencies needed for testing (such as
``nox`` and NumPy).

On Travis CI, Matthew Brett's `multibuild`_ is used to install "official"
python.org CPython binaries for macOS. Then tests are run in 64-bit
mode (NumPy has `discontinued`_ 32-bit support).

On AppVeyor, the binary extension is built and tested with both 32-bit and
64-bit Python binaries.

****************************************
Release Process / Deploying New Versions
****************************************

New versions are pushed to `PyPI`_ manually after a ``git`` tag is
created. The process is manual (rather than automated) for several
reasons:

* The documentation and README (which acts as the landing page text on
  PyPI) will be updated with links scoped to the versioned tag (rather
  than ``master``). This update occurs via the ``doc_template_release.py``
  script.
* Several badges on the documentation landing page (``index.rst``) are
  irrelevant to a fixed version (such as the "latest" version of the
  package).
* The build badges in the README and the documentation will be
  changed to point to a fixed (and passing) build that has already
  completed (will be the build that occurred when the tag was pushed). If
  the builds pushed to PyPI automatically, a build would need to
  link to itself **while** being run.
* Wheels need be built for Linux, macOS and Windows. This process
  is **becoming** better, but is still scattered across many
  different build systems. Each wheel will be pushed directly to
  PyPI via `twine`_.
* The release will be manually pushed to `TestPyPI`_ so the landing
  page can be visually inspected and the package can be installed
  from TestPyPI rather than from a local file.

.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/bezier/
.. _twine: https://packaging.python.org/distributing/

Supported Python Versions
=========================

``bezier`` explicitly supports:

-  `Python 3.6`_
-  `Python 3.7`_
-  `Python 3.8`_
-  `PyPy 3`_

.. _Python 3.6: https://docs.python.org/3.6/
.. _Python 3.7: https://docs.python.org/3.7/
.. _Python 3.8: https://docs.python.org/3.8/
.. _PyPy 3: https://pypy.org/

Supported versions can be found in the ``noxfile.py`` `config`_.

.. _config: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/{revision}/noxfile.py

Versioning
==========

``bezier`` follows `calendar versioning`_.

.. _calendar versioning: https://calver.org/

*********************
Environment Variables
*********************

This project uses environment variables for building the
``bezier._speedup`` binary extension:

- ``BEZIER_INSTALL_PREFIX``: A directory where ``libbezier`` is installed,
  including the shared library (``lib/``) and headers (``include/``). This
  environment variable is required to build the binary extension.
- ``BEZIER_NO_EXTENSION``: If set, this will indicate that only the pure
  Python package should be built and installed (i.e. without the binary
  extension).

for interacting with the system at import time:

- ``PATH``: On Windows, we add the ``bezier/extra-dll`` package directory to
  the path so that the ``bezier.dll`` shared libary can be loaded at
  import time for Python versions **before** 3.8. After 3.8, modifying ``PATH``
  no longer works for these purposes; the ``os.add_dll_directory()``
  `function <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.add_dll_directory>`__
  is used.

and for running tests and interacting with Continuous Integration
services:

- ``WHEELHOUSE``: If set, this gives a path to prebuilt NumPy and SciPy wheels
  for PyPy 3.
- ``GENERATE_IMAGES``: Indicates to ``nox -s doctest`` that images should
  be generated during cleanup of each test case.
- ``READTHEDOCS``: Indicates currently running on Read The Docs (RTD). This is
  used to tell Sphinx to use the RTD theme when **not** running on RTD.
- ``COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN``: To upload the coverage report.
