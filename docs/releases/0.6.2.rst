Python Changes
--------------

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Converted ``CHANGELOG.md`` file into a
   `releases <https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.6.2/releases/index.html>`__
   docs page
   (`0027cd7 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/0027cd7b51433c6b3542f077b08c555ff287e10b>`__).

Non-Public API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Collapsed all Cython-generated modules into a single ``bezier._speedup``
   module (`8bcb319 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/8bcb319c6dcb9e523037d688028d8a38c6b2b630>`__).

   -  This is the change that **prompted the release**.
   -  Dropped the five ``bezier._HAS_*_SPEEDUP`` members for a single
      ``bezier._HAS_SPEEDUP`` (this was the previous approach
      before ``0.6.0``).
   -  Renamed a few of the Cython helper functions to avoid name collision.
   -  This was done to fix a bug and prevent future bugs. The issue was that a
      mutable Fortran global (``MAX_CANDIDATES``) was being included via an
      object file in **separate** extension modules. When one module updated
      the global, the other module never saw the update (because it was a
      different copy).
