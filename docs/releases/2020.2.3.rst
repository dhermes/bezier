ABI Changes
-----------

Packaging
~~~~~~~~~

-  Introduced first-class build and install support for ``libbezier`` via
   `CMake`_. Achieved with the following PRs

   -  Added ``CMakeLists.txt`` files to enable building ``libbezier`` with
      `CMake`_ (`#175 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/175>`__).
   -  Added ``-DTARGET_NATIVE_ARCH:BOOL=OFF`` flag to enable portable release
      builds (`#182 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/182>`__).

   and closed the following issues

   -  Use a shared library (rather than a static library) for ``libbezier``
      (`#54 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/54>`__).
   -  Enable Python installs to be "hybrid-editable"
      (`#56 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/56>`__). (This means that
      the Python files reference the source tree but the built components, i.e.
      ``libbezier`` and ``_speedup.so``, are already built and utilize caching
      of `CMake`_.)
   -  Use build system other than Python / ``distutils`` / ``setuptools``
      (`#62 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/62>`__).
   -  Add ability to disable ``-march=native`` flag to make release builds
      portable across compatible operating systems
      (`#181 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/181>`__).

Python Changes
--------------

Additive Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Exposing ``Curve.evaluate_hodograph()``
   `method <https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/2020.2.3/python/reference/bezier.curve.html#bezier.curve.Curve.evaluate_hodograph>`__
   as part of the public API
   (`#191 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/191>`__).
   Fixed `#138 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/138>`__.

Packaging
~~~~~~~~~

-  Removed build dependency on ``gfortran`` and other heavyweight tools (and
   hacks) such as ``numpy.distutils``. Now, ``libbezier`` must be built before
   the Python package can be installed and the install location must be
   provided via the ``BEZIER_INSTALL_PREFIX`` environment variable. Achieved
   with the following PRs

   -  Requiring prebuilt ``libbezier`` when building ``bezier._speedup`` Python
      binary extension (`#176 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/176>`__).
   -  Support building of wheels on all platforms that depend on
      ``libbezier`` (`#182 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/182>`__).

-  Switch from ``manylinux1`` to ``manylinux2010`` for built wheels
   (`#178 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/178>`__).
-  Delaying imports of ``pkg_resources``, ``scipy`` and ``sympy`` until
   actually needed (if ever)
   (`#194 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/194>`__,
   `#195 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/195>`__,
   `38602d8 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/38602d88714b5358fdab2730392c7bbf27b2b8c2>`__).
-  Adding ``matplotlib`` to ``pip install bezier[full]``
   (`8beb036 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/8beb036ce06decb26ae25de118a8a3778c18c519>`__).
-  Avoiding ``bezier.dll`` name collision on Windows in wheels distributed on
   PyPI
   (`#190 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/190>`__).
   Fixed `#189 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/189>`__.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Removed ``bezier.get_dll()`` helper
   (`#184 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/184>`__).

Documentation
--------------

-  Changed "Read the Docs" landing page to point to ``.../stable/``
   documentation (i.e. the last published release) instead of ``.../latest``
   documentation (i.e. the last **merged** commit).
-  Making sure `CMake`_ installed trees (on Linux, macOS and Windows) are
   verified in ``doctest`` as part of CI
   (`48e4166 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/48e416651878f02f7fce35e4944c56ba98463427>`__).
-  Making sure ``example_*.c`` ABI examples are compiled and run (on Linux
   and macOS) in ``doctest`` as part of CI
   (`ffdcdf7 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/ffdcdf7e0b6608bb2a2b37337abbf49090f922c2>`__,
   `9551495 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/95514952d54224d52d909876cb54bb75e672b653>`__,
   `0766649 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/07666494a318d81770323a03aba694a282a8434b>`__).
-  Converting (untested, potentially stale) console codeblocks to ``doctest``
   (that get run in CI) for Linux sections of binary extension documentation
   (`#188 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/188>`__).
   Fixed `#74 <https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/74>`__.
