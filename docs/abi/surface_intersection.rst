   :trim:

This is a collection of procedures and types for computing intersections
between two B |eacute| zier surfaces in :math:`\mathbf{R}^2`. The region(s)
of intersection (if non-empty) will be curved polygons defined by
the B |eacute| zier curve segments that form the exterior.

.. note::

    In most of the procedures below both the number of nodes :math:`N` and
    the degree :math:`d` of a B |eacute| zier surface are provided. It is
    redundant to require both as arguments since :math:`N = \binom{d + 2}{2}`.
    However, both are provided as arguments to avoid unnecessary
    re-computation, i.e. we expect the caller to know both :math:`N` and
    :math:`d`.

.. c:function:: void BEZ_locate_point_surface(int *num_nodes, \
                                              double *nodes, \
                                              int *degree, \
                                              double *x_val, \
                                              double *y_val, \
                                              double *s_val, \
                                              double *t_val)

   This solves the inverse problem :math:`B(s, t) = (x, y)` (if it can be
   solved). Does so by subdividing the surface until the sub-surfaces are
   sufficiently small, then using Newton's method to narrow in on the
   pre-image of the point.

   This assumes the surface is "valid", i.e. it has positive Jacobian
   throughout the unit triangle. (If this were not true, then multiple
   inputs could map to the same output.)

   :param int* num_nodes:
      **[Input]** The number of nodes :math:`N` in the control net of the
      B |eacute| zier surface.
   :param double* nodes:
      **[Input]** The actual control net of the B |eacute| zier surface as a
      :math:`2 \times N` array. This should be laid out in Fortran order, with
      :math:`2 N` total values.
   :param int* degree:
      **[Input]** The degree :math:`d` of the B |eacute| zier surface.
   :param double* x_val:
      **[Input]** The :math:`x`\-value of the point being located.
   :param double* y_val:
      **[Input]** The :math:`y`\-value of the point being located.
   :param double* s_val:
      **[Output]** The first parameter :math:`s` of the solution. If
      :math:`(x, y)` can't be located on the surface, then ``s_val = -1.0``.
   :param double* t_val:
      **[Output]** The second parameter :math:`t` of the solution. If
      :math:`(x, y)` can't be located on the surface, then this value
      is undefined.

   This refines a solution to :math:`B(s, t) = (x, y) = p` using Newton's
   method. Given a current approximation :math:`(s_n, t_n)` for a solution,
   this produces the updated approximation via

   .. math::

      \left[\begin{array}{c} s_{n + 1} \\ t_{n + 1} \end{array}\right] =
      \left[\begin{array}{c} s_n \\ t_n \end{array}\right] -
      DB(s_n, t_n)^{-1} \left(B(s_n, t_n) - p\right).

   :param int* num_nodes:
      **[Input]** The number of nodes :math:`N` in the control net of the
      B |eacute| zier surface.
   :param double* nodes:
      **[Input]** The actual control net of the B |eacute| zier surface as a
      :math:`2 \times N` array. This should be laid out in Fortran order, with
      :math:`2 N` total values.
   :param int* degree:
      **[Input]** The degree :math:`d` of the B |eacute| zier surface.
   :param double* x_val:
      **[Input]** The :math:`x`\-value of the point :math:`p`.
   :param double* y_val:
      **[Input]** The :math:`y`\-value of the point :math:`p`.
   :param double* s:
      **[Input]** The first parameter :math:`s_n` of the current approximation
      of a solution.

   Compute the intersection of two B |eacute| zier surfaces. This will
   first compute all intersection points between edges of the first and
   second surface (nine edge pairs in total). Then, it will classify each
   point according to which surface is "interior" at that point. Finally,
   it will form a loop of intersection points using the classifications
   until all intersections have been used or discarded.

   .. tip::

      If the ``status`` returned is :c:data:`INSUFFICIENT_SPACE` that means
      either

      * ``segment_ends_size`` is smaller than ``num_intersected``
        so ``segment_ends`` needs to be resized to at least as large as
        ``num_intersected``.
      * ``segments_size`` is smaller than the number of segments. The number
        of segments will be the last index in the list of edge indices:
        ``segment_ends[num_intersected - 1]``. In this case ``segments``
        needs to be resized.

      This means a successful invocation of this procedure may take three
      attempts. To avoid false starts occurring on a regular basis, keep a
      static workspace around that will continue to grow as resizing is
      needed, but will never shrink.

   :param int* num_nodes1:
      **[Input]** The number of nodes :math:`N_1` in the control net of the
      first B |eacute| zier surface.
   :param double* nodes1:
      **[Input]** The actual control net of the first B |eacute| zier surface
      as a :math:`2 \times N_1` array. This should be laid out in Fortran
      order, with :math:`2 N_1` total values.
   :param int* degree1:
      **[Input]** The degree :math:`d_1` of the first B |eacute| zier surface.
   :param int* num_nodes2:
      **[Input]** The number of nodes :math:`N_2` in the control net of the
      second B |eacute| zier surface.
   :param double* nodes2:
      **[Input]** The actual control net of the second B |eacute| zier surface
      as a :math:`2 \times N_2` array. This should be laid out in Fortran
      order, with :math:`2 N_2` total values.
   :param int* degree2:
      **[Input]** The degree :math:`d_2` of the second B |eacute| zier surface.
   :param int* segment_ends_size:
      **[Input]** The size of ``segment_ends``, which must be pre-allocated by
      the caller.
   :param int* segment_ends:
      **[Output]** An array (pre-allocated by the caller) of the end indices
      for each group of segments in ``segments``. For example, if the surfaces
      intersect in two distinct curved polygons, the first of which has four
      sides and the second of which has three, then the first two values in
      ``segment_ends`` will be ``[4, 7]`` and ``num_intersected`` will be
      ``2``.
   :param int* segments_size:
      **[Input]** The size of ``segments``, which must be pre-allocated by
      the caller.
   :param CurvedPolygonSegment* segments:
      **[Output]** An array (pre-allocated by the caller) of the edge segments
      that make up the boundary of the curved polygon(s) that form the
      intersection of the two surfaces.
   :param int* num_intersected:
      **[Output]** The number of curved polygons in the intersection of two
      surfaces.
   :param SurfaceContained* contained:
      **[Output]** Enum indicating if one surface is **fully** contained in
      the other.
   :param Status* status:
      **[Output]** The status code for the procedure. Will be

      * :c:data:`SUCCESS` on success.
      * :c:data:`INSUFFICIENT_SPACE` if ``segment_ends_size`` is smaller than
        ``num_intersected`` **or** if ``segments_size`` is smaller than the
        number of segments.
      * :c:data:`UNKNOWN` if the intersection points are classified in an
        unexpected way (e.g. if there is both an ignored corner and a tangent
        intersection, but no other types).
      * :c:data:`NO_CONVERGE` if the two curves in an edge pair don't converge
        to approximately linear after being subdivided 20 times. (This error
        will occur via :c:func:`curve_intersections`.)
      * An integer :math:`N_C \geq 64` to indicate that there were :math:`N_C`
        pairs of candidate segments during edge-edge intersection that had
        overlapping convex hulls. This is a sign of either round-off error
        in detecting that the edges are coincident curve segments on the same
        algebraic curve or that the intersection is a non-simple root. (This
        error will occur via :c:func:`curve_intersections`.)
      * :c:data:`BAD_MULTIPLICITY` if the two curves in an edge pair have an
        intersection that doesn't converge to either a simple or double root
        via Newton's method. (This error will occur via
        :c:func:`curve_intersections`.)
      * :c:data:`EDGE_END` If there is an attempt to add an intersection
        point with either the :math:`s` or :math:`t`\-parameter equal to 1
        (i.e. if the intersection is at the end of an edge). This should
        not occur because such intersections are "rotated" to the beginning
        of the neighboring edge before the boundary of the curved polygon
        is formed.
      * :c:data:`SAME_CURVATURE` if the two curves in an edge pair have
        identical curvature at a tangent intersection.
      * :c:data:`BAD_INTERIOR` if a curved polygon requires more than
        10 sides. This could be due to either a particular complex
        intersection, a programming error or round-off which causes an
        infinite loop of intersection points to be added without wrapping
        around back to the first intersection point.

Types
*****

.. c:type:: CurvedPolygonSegment

   Describes an edge of a :class:`.CurvedPolygon` formed when intersecting
   two curved B |eacute| zier surfaces. The edges of the intersection need
   not be an entire edge of one of the surfaces. For example, an edge
   :math:`E(s)` may be restricted to
   :math:`E\left(\left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{7}{8}\right]\right)`.

   .. c:type:: double start

      The start parameter of the segment. In the restriction
      :math:`E\left(\left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{7}{8}\right]\right)`, the
      ``start`` would be ``0.25``.

   .. c:type:: double end

      The end parameter of the segment. In the restriction
      :math:`E\left(\left[\frac{1}{4}, \frac{7}{8}\right]\right)`, the
      ``end`` would be ``0.875``.

   .. c:type:: int edge_index

      An index describing which edge the segment falls on. The edges
      of the first surface in the intersection are given index values
      of ``1``, ``2`` and ``3`` while those of the second surface are
      ``4``, ``5`` and ``6``.

   In the header ``bezier/surface_intersection.h``, this is defined as

   .. code-block:: c

      typedef struct CurvedPolygonSegment {
        double start;
        double end;
        int edge_index;
      } CurvedPolygonSegment;

.. c:type:: SurfaceContained

   This enum is used to indicate if one surface is contained in
   another when doing surface-surface intersection.

   .. c:var:: NEITHER

      (``0``)
      Indicates that neither surface is contained in the other. This
      could mean the surfaces are disjoint or that they intersect
      in a way other than full containment.

   .. c:var:: FIRST

      (``1``)
      Indicates that the first surface (arguments will be ordered) is
      fully contained in the second. This allows for points of tangency,
      shared corners or shared segments along an edge.

   .. c:var:: SECOND

      (``2``)
      Indicates that the second surface (arguments will be ordered) is
      fully contained in the first. This allows for points of tangency,
      shared corners or shared segments along an edge.
