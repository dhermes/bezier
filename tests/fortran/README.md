This is so that the Fortran source can evolve without having to have an
equivalent Python function for every piece of code.

```
$ make

Usage:
   make unit          Build and run unit tests
   make lcov          Run unit tests with coverage
   make functional    Build and run functional tests
   make clean         Clean generated files
