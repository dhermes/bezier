r"""Proof-of-concept for B |eacute| zier clipping.

.. _algorithm: https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0010-4485(90)90039-F
.. _quadratic convergence: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cagd.2007.12.006

The B |eacute| zier clipping `algorithm`_ is used to intersect
two planar B |eacute| zier curves. It proceeds by using "fat lines"
to recursively prune the region of accepted parameter ranges until
the ranges converge to points. (A "fat line" is a rectangular region of a
bounded distance from the line connecting the start and end points of a
B |eacute| zier curve.)

It has `quadratic convergence`_. It can be used to find tangent intersections,
which is the primary usage within ``bezier``.

       is meant to be used (within this library) to find tangent intersections
       for already subdivided (i.e. sufficiently zoomed in) curve segments.

    Two B |eacute| zier curves :math:`B_1(s)` and :math:`B_2(t)` are defined by
    ``nodes1`` and ``nodes2``. The "fat line" (see :func:`compute_fat_line`)
    for :math:`B_1(s)` is used to narrow the range of possible :math:`t`-values
    in an intersection by considering the (non-normalized) distance polynomial
    for :math:`B_2(t)`:

    .. math::

       d(t) = \sum_{j = 0}^m \binom{m}{j} t^j (1 - t)^{m - j} \cdot d_j

    Here :math:`d_j = a x_j + b y_j + c` are the (non-normalized) distances of
    each control point
    :math:`\left[\begin{array}{c} x_j \\ y_j \end{array}\right]`
    of :math:`B_2(t)` to the implicit line for :math:`B_1(s)`.
