def linearization_error(nodes):
    r"""Compute the maximum error of a linear approximation.

    .. note::

       There is also a Fortran implementation of this function, which
       will be used if it can be built.

    .. note::

       This is a helper for :class:`.Linearization`, which is used during the
       curve-curve intersection process.

    We use the line

    .. math::

       L(s) = v_0 (1 - s) + v_n s

    and compute a bound on the maximum error

    .. math::

       \max_{s \in \left[0, 1\right]} \|B(s) - L(s)\|_2.

    Rather than computing the actual maximum (a tight bound), we
    use an upper bound via the remainder from Lagrange interpolation
    in each component. This leaves us with :math:`\frac{s(s - 1)}{2!}`
    times the second derivative in each component.

    The second derivative curve is degree :math:`d = n - 2` and
    is given by

    .. math::

       B''(s) = n(n - 1) \sum_{j = 0}^{d} \binom{d}{j} s^j
       (1 - s)^{d - j} \cdot \Delta^2 v_j

    Due to this form (and the convex combination property of
    B |eacute| zier Curves) we know each component of the second derivative
    will be bounded by the maximum of that component among the
    :math:`\Delta^2 v_j`.

    For example, the curve

    .. math::

       B(s) = \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right] (1 - s)^2
           + \left[\begin{array}{c} 3 \\ 1 \end{array}\right] 2s(1 - s)
           + \left[\begin{array}{c} 9 \\ -2 \end{array}\right] s^2

    has
    :math:`B''(s) \equiv \left[\begin{array}{c} 6 \\ -8 \end{array}\right]`
    which has norm :math:`10` everywhere, hence the maximum error is

    .. math::

       \left.\frac{s(1 - s)}{2!} \cdot 10\right|_{s = \frac{1}{2}}
          = \frac{5}{4}.

    .. image:: ../../images/linearization_error.png

    .. testsetup:: linearization-error, linearization-error-fail

       import numpy as np

    .. testcleanup:: linearization-error

       import make_images
       make_images.linearization_error(nodes)

    As a **non-example**, consider a "pathological" set of control points:

    .. math::

       B(s) = \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right] (1 - s)^3
           + \left[\begin{array}{c} 5 \\ 12 \end{array}\right] 3s(1 - s)^2
           + \left[\begin{array}{c} 10 \\ 24 \end{array}\right] 3s^2(1 - s)
           + \left[\begin{array}{c} 30 \\ 72 \end{array}\right] s^3

    By construction, this lies on the line :math:`y = \frac{12x}{5}`, but
    the parametrization is cubic:
    :math:`12 \cdot x(s) = 5 \cdot y(s) = 180s(s^2 + 1)`. Hence, the fact
    that the curve is a line is not accounted for and we take the worse
    case among the nodes in:

    .. math::

       B''(s) = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot \left(
           \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right] (1 - s)
           + \left[\begin{array}{c} 15 \\ 36 \end{array}\right] s\right)

    which gives a nonzero maximum error:

    .. doctest:: linearization-error-fail

       >>> nodes = np.asfortranarray([
       ...     [0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 30.0],
       ...     [0.0, 12.0, 24.0, 72.0],
       ... ])
       >>> linearization_error(nodes)
       29.25

    Though it may seem that ``0`` is a more appropriate answer, consider
    the **goal** of this function. We seek to linearize curves and then
    intersect the linear approximations. Then the :math:`s`-values from
    the line-line intersection is lifted back to the curves. Thus
    the error :math:`\|B(s) - L(s)\|_2` is more relevant than the
    underlying algebraic curve containing :math:`B(s)`.

    .. note::

       It may be more appropriate to use a **relative** linearization error
       rather than the **absolute** error provided here. It's unclear if
       the domain :math:`\left[0, 1\right]` means the error is **already**
       adequately scaled or if the error should be scaled by the arc
       length of the curve or the (easier-to-compute) length of the line.

    Args:
        nodes (numpy.ndarray): Nodes of a curve.

    Returns:
        float: The maximum error between the curve and the
        linear approximation.

def segment_intersection(start0, end0, start1, end1):
    r"""Determine the intersection of two line segments.

    Assumes each line is parametric

    .. math::

       \begin{alignat*}{2}
        L_0(s) &= S_0 (1 - s) + E_0 s &&= S_0 + s \Delta_0 \\
        L_1(t) &= S_1 (1 - t) + E_1 t &&= S_1 + t \Delta_1.
       \end{alignat*}

    To solve :math:`S_0 + s \Delta_0 = S_1 + t \Delta_1`, we use the
    cross product:

    .. math::

       \left(S_0 + s \Delta_0\right) \times \Delta_1 =
           \left(S_1 + t \Delta_1\right) \times \Delta_1 \Longrightarrow
       s \left(\Delta_0 \times \Delta_1\right) =
           \left(S_1 - S_0\right) \times \Delta_1.

    Similarly

    .. math::

       \Delta_0 \times \left(S_0 + s \Delta_0\right) =
           \Delta_0 \times \left(S_1 + t \Delta_1\right) \Longrightarrow
       \left(S_1 - S_0\right) \times \Delta_0 =
           \Delta_0 \times \left(S_0 - S_1\right) =
           t \left(\Delta_0 \times \Delta_1\right).

    .. note::

       Since our points are in :math:`\mathbf{R}^2`, the "traditional"
       cross product in :math:`\mathbf{R}^3` will always point in the
       :math:`z` direction, so in the above we mean the :math:`z`
       component of the cross product, rather than the entire vector.

    For example, the diagonal lines

    .. math::

       \begin{align*}
        L_0(s) &= \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right] (1 - s) +

                  \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right] t

    L_1\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) =

    Meant as a back-up when :func:`segment_intersection` fails.

    .. note::

       This function assumes but never verifies that the lines
       are parallel.

    In the case that the segments are parallel and lie on **different**
    lines, then there is a **guarantee** of no intersection. However, if
    they are on the exact same line, they may define a shared segment
    coincident to both lines.

    In :func:`segment_intersection`, we utilized the normal form of the
    lines (via the cross product):

    checking if

       S_0 \times \Delta_0 \stackrel{?}{=} S_1 \times \Delta_0.

    If it is not on the first line, then we are done, the

    :math:`S_1` and :math:`E_1` define parameters outside of

    .. math::

    :math:`S_1 = S_0 + \frac{3}{2} \Delta_0` and
