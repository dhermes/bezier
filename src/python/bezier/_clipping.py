r"""Proof-of-concept for B |eacute| zier clipping.

.. _algorithm: https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0010-4485(90)90039-F

The B |eacute| zier clipping `algorithm`_ is used to intersect
two planar B |eacute| zier curves. It proceeds by using "fat lines"
to recursively prune the region of accepted parameter ranges until
the ranges converge to points. (A "fat line" is a rectangular region of a
bounded distance from the line connecting the start and end points of a
B |eacute| zier curve.)

It has quadratic convergence. It can be used to find tangent intersections,
which is the primary usage within ``bezier``.
