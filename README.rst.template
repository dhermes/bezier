Why B |eacute| zier?
--------------------

A B |eacute| zier curves (and surface, etc.) is a parametric curve
that uses the `Bernstein basis`_:

.. image:: https://cdn.rawgit.com/dhermes/bezier/{revision}/docs/images/bernstein_basis.png
   :align: center

to define a curve as a linear combination:

   :align: center

This comes from the fact that the weights sum to one:

   :align: center

This can be generalized to higher order by considering three, four, etc.
non-negative weights that sum to one (in the above we have the two
non-negative weights ``s`` and ``1 - s``).

Due to their simple form, B |eacute| zier curves:

* can easily model geometric objects as parametric curves, surfaces, etc.
* can be computed in an efficient and numerically stable way via
  `de Casteljau's algorithm`_
* can utilize convex optimization techniques for many algorithms (such as
  curve-curve intersection), since curves (and surfaces, etc.)
  are convex combinations of the basis

Many applications -- as well as the history of their development --
are described in
"The Bernstein polynomial basis: A centennial `retrospective`_",
for example;

* aids physical analysis using finite element methods (`FEM`_) on
  isogeometric models by using geometric shape functions called
  `NURBS`_ to represent data
* used in robust control of dynamic systems; utilizes convexity to
  create a hull of curves

Installing
----------

``bezier`` can be installed with `pip`_:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip              install --upgrade bezier
   $ python    -m pip install --upgrade bezier --user
   $ python2.7 -m pip install --upgrade bezier --user
   $ python3.6 -m pip install --upgrade bezier --user

``bezier`` is open-source, so you can alternatively grab the source
code from `GitHub`_ and install from source.

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io
.. _GitHub: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/

Getting Started
---------------

For example, to create a curve:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> nodes1 = np.asfortranarray([
   ...     [0.0, 0.0],
   ...     [0.5, 1.0],
   ...     [1.0, 0.0],
   ... ])
   >>> curve1 = bezier.Curve(nodes1, degree=2)

The intersection (points) between two curves can
also be determined:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> nodes2 = np.asfortranarray([
   ...     [0.0 ,  0.0],
   ...     [0.25,  2.0],
   ...     [0.5 , -2.0],
   ...     [0.75,  2.0],
   ...     [1.0 ,  0.0],
   ... ])
   >>> curve2 = bezier.Curve.from_nodes(nodes2)
   >>> intersections = curve1.intersect(curve2)
   >>> intersections
   array([[ 0.31101776, 0.42857143],
          [ 0.68898224, 0.42857143],
          [ 0.        , 0.        ],
          [ 1.        , 0.        ]])

and then we can plot these curves (along with their
intersections):

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   >>> import seaborn
   >>> seaborn.set()
   >>>
   >>> ax = curve1.plot(num_pts=256)
   >>> _ = curve2.plot(num_pts=256, ax=ax)
   >>> lines = ax.plot(
   ...     intersections[:, 0], intersections[:, 1],
   ...     marker='o', linestyle='None', color='black')
   >>> _ = ax.axis('scaled')
   >>> _ = ax.set_xlim(-0.125, 1.125)
   >>> _ = ax.set_ylim(-0.0625, 0.625)
   >>> plt.show()
