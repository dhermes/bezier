# This is a script to run tests the same way GitHub Actions does, but on a
# local development Apple laptop. This handles
# - checking that the "official" CPython is installed where expected
# - checking that ``gfortran`` is installed
# - setting of relevant environment variables
# - make sure we have a latest `nox`, `pip`, `numpy` and `virtualenv`
# - puts the "local" Python at the front of `PATH`
